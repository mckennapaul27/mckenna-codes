                        For the last 8 years (can&apos;t believe it&apos;s been
                        that long!) I have been running affiliate businesses in
                        numerous sectors but primarily focussed on gaming and
                        finance.

                        During the early period of working for myself I was
                        using outsourced developers from many different
                        countries around the world to build my websites.
